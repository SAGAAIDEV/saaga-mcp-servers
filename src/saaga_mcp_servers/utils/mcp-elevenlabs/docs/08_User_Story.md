## User Story 1: Basic Text-to-Speech Conversion

**Story ID:** VOICE-101  
**Title:** Convert AI agent text responses to natural speech  
**Story Type:** Functional  
**Epic/Feature:** VOICE-001 - Voice-Enable AI Agents  
**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Estimation:** 8 Story Points  

### Story Description

As an **AI agent developer**,  
I want **to convert text responses to natural speech using a simple MCP tool call**,  
So that **my AI agent can provide voice output for accessibility and enhanced user experience**.

**Business Context:**  
Currently, 15% of potential users cannot effectively use text-only AI agents due to accessibility needs or situational constraints (driving, visual impairment, multitasking). This story enables the core voice synthesis capability that transforms text-based AI interactions into natural conversational experiences.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1 - Happy Path:**
```gherkin
Given an MCP-enabled AI agent with the ElevenLabs server running,
When the agent calls elevenlabs.speak with text "Hello, how can I help you today?",
Then audio is generated and returned within 500ms,
And the audio sounds natural with appropriate intonation.
```

**AC2 - Error Handling:**
```gherkin
Given the ElevenLabs API is unavailable,
When the agent attempts to call elevenlabs.speak,
Then an MCP error response is returned with code -32603,
And the error message clearly indicates "ElevenLabs API unavailable".
```

**AC3 - Boundary Conditions:**
```gherkin
Given a text input exceeding 5000 characters,
When elevenlabs.speak is called,
Then the text is automatically chunked into valid segments,
And audio is generated for each segment seamlessly.
```

**AC4 - Performance:**
```gherkin
Given normal operating conditions with <100 concurrent requests,
When elevenlabs.speak is called,
Then the first audio byte is returned within 500ms for 95% of requests,
And complete audio generation takes <2 seconds for 100-word texts.
```

### Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] MCP tool "elevenlabs.speak" implemented and discoverable
- [ ] Unit tests written with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with mock ElevenLabs API
- [ ] Error handling for all API failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting <500ms requirement
- [ ] API documentation in MCP tool description
- [ ] Manual testing with real AI agent
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security review for API key handling

### Dependencies

**Hard Dependencies:**
- ElevenLabs API account and valid API key
- MCP SDK Python implementation (v1.1+)
- Python 3.11+ runtime environment

**Soft Dependencies:**
- Example AI agent for testing
- Performance monitoring setup

### Technical Considerations

**API Integration:**
- Use ElevenLabs Python SDK for API calls
- Implement streaming for real-time audio delivery
- Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff

**Security Implications:**
- API key stored in environment variables only
- No logging of API keys or user text
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement connection pooling for API requests
- Use asyncio for non-blocking operations
- Consider caching for repeated phrases

### Test Strategy

**Unit Testing:**
- Text validation and sanitization
- API request formatting
- Response parsing and error handling

**Integration Testing:**
- Mock ElevenLabs API responses
- Test various text lengths and languages
- Verify streaming functionality

**End-to-End Testing:**
- Real API calls with test account
- Measure actual latency metrics
- Test with multiple voice options

## User Story 2: Voice Selection and Management

**Story ID:** VOICE-102  
**Title:** List and select from available ElevenLabs voices  
**Story Type:** Functional  
**Epic/Feature:** VOICE-001 - Voice-Enable AI Agents  
**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Estimation:** 5 Story Points  

### Story Description

As an **end user of an AI agent**,  
I want **to choose from available voices and set my preferred voice**,  
So that **I can have a consistent, personalized voice experience across sessions**.

**Business Context:**  
Voice preference is highly personal - users may prefer voices based on accent, gender, age, or other characteristics. Providing voice selection ensures users can find a voice that feels comfortable and natural for extended interactions.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1 - List Available Voices:**
```gherkin
Given the ElevenLabs server is running,
When elevenlabs.list_voices is called,
Then a list of all available voices is returned,
And each voice includes id, name, and characteristics metadata.
```

**AC2 - Set Default Voice:**
```gherkin
Given a valid voice_id from the available voices,
When elevenlabs.set_default_voice is called with that voice_id,
Then the voice is saved as the user's default,
And subsequent speak calls use this voice unless overridden.
```

**AC3 - Voice Validation:**
```gherkin
Given an invalid or unavailable voice_id,
When elevenlabs.set_default_voice is called,
Then an error is returned indicating "Voice not available",
And the previous default voice remains unchanged.
```

**AC4 - Voice Persistence:**
```gherkin
Given a default voice has been set,
When the MCP server is restarted,
Then the default voice preference is maintained,
And speak calls continue using the saved preference.
```

### Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] elevenlabs.list_voices tool implemented
- [ ] elevenlabs.set_default_voice tool implemented
- [ ] Voice preference storage mechanism implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for voice management logic
- [ ] Integration tests for preference persistence
- [ ] Voice metadata properly formatted
- [ ] Error handling for invalid voices
- [ ] Documentation for voice selection

### Dependencies

**Hard Dependencies:**
- User Story VOICE-101 (basic TTS functionality)
- Local storage mechanism for preferences

**Soft Dependencies:**
- UI for voice selection (future story)

### Technical Considerations

**Storage Approach:**
- JSON file in user config directory
- Atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Fallback to default if preference corrupted

**API Optimization:**
- Cache voice list for 1 hour
- Refresh cache on selection failure
- Include voice preview URLs if available

## User Story 4: Streaming Audio Delivery

**Story ID:** VOICE-104  
**Title:** Stream audio output for real-time playback  
**Story Type:** Technical/Enabler  
**Epic/Feature:** VOICE-001 - Voice-Enable AI Agents  
**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Estimation:** 8 Story Points  

### Story Description

As a **system component**,  
I need **to stream audio data as it's generated rather than waiting for completion**,  
So that **users experience minimal latency and can begin hearing speech immediately**.

**Business Context:**  
Waiting for complete audio generation before playback creates 2-3 second delays that break conversational flow. Streaming allows playback to begin within 500ms while generation continues in the background.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1 - Streaming Initialization:**
```gherkin
Given a text-to-speech request,
When streaming is enabled,
Then the first audio chunk is delivered within 500ms,
And subsequent chunks arrive continuously.
```

**AC2 - Buffer Management:**
```gherkin
Given audio streaming in progress,
When network latency varies,
Then buffering prevents playback interruption,
And buffer size stays between 100-500ms of audio.
```

**AC3 - Chunk Encoding:**
```gherkin
Given audio chunks being streamed,
When chunks are delivered to the client,
Then each chunk is base64 encoded,
And includes metadata for sequencing.
```

**AC4 - Stream Completion:**
```gherkin
Given a streaming session in progress,
When all audio has been generated,
Then a completion marker is sent,
And the client can properly close the stream.
```

**AC5 - Error Recovery:**
```gherkin
Given a stream interrupted by network issues,
When connection is restored,
Then streaming can resume from last checkpoint,
And no audio data is lost or duplicated.
```

### Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] WebSocket streaming implementation
- [ ] Chunk encoding and sequencing
- [ ] Buffer management logic
- [ ] Stream state management
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Unit tests for streaming logic
- [ ] Integration tests with network simulation
- [ ] Performance tests under various conditions
- [ ] Client-side integration example

### Dependencies

**Hard Dependencies:**
- ElevenLabs streaming API support
- WebSocket support in MCP transport

**Soft Dependencies:**
- Client-side audio player implementation

### Technical Considerations

**Streaming Architecture:**
- Use ElevenLabs WebSocket API
- Implement backpressure handling
- Chunk size optimization (2-4KB)
- Memory-efficient buffering

**Error Handling:**
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Checkpoint management
- Graceful degradation to non-streaming
