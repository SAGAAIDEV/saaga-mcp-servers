# Project Vision Statement: Ambient Agent

## 1. Core Purpose
The Ambient Agent is a lightweight Python monitoring service that continuously observes Jira for new project tasks and automatically triggers Claude code execution with corresponding project commands, eliminating manual task monitoring overhead and enabling autonomous task-to-action workflow automation.

## 2. Target Audience
Development teams and project managers who use Jira for task management and require automated task execution, specifically those who:
- Manage multiple Jira projects with recurring automation needs
- Use Claude code for task implementation
- Need hands-free task monitoring and execution
- Value simple, reliable automation tools with minimal configuration

## 3. Unique Value Proposition
Unlike complex workflow automation platforms, the Ambient Agent provides a minimalist, single-purpose solution that bridges Jira task management with Claude code execution through a simple polling mechanism, requiring no webhooks, complex integrations, or extensive configuration while maintaining full visibility and control over automated actions.

## 4. Essential Capabilities
- **Jira Task Monitoring**: Poll Jira API every minute to detect new tasks across configured projects
- **Task Detection Logic**: Identify genuinely new tasks while avoiding duplicate processing
- **Claude Code Integration**: Spawn subprocess to execute Claude code with task-specific commands
- **Process Management**: Handle subprocess lifecycle, output capture, and error conditions
- **Minimal Configuration**: Simple YAML/environment-based configuration for Jira credentials and project mappings

## 5. Evolution Strategy
Over 1-3 years, the Ambient Agent will evolve from a simple polling service to an intelligent task orchestration system, incorporating:
- **Year 1**: Enhanced task filtering rules, multiple Jira instance support, and basic task prioritization
- **Year 2**: Task dependency resolution, parallel execution capabilities, and integration with additional project management tools
- **Year 3**: ML-based task classification, predictive task routing, and comprehensive execution analytics
