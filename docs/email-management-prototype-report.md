# Email Management Prototype Session Report

## Executive Summary

This document reports on a prototype session demonstrating Claude Code's capabilities for email inbox management using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The session tested browser automation and API-based approaches for managing emails, unsubscribing from mailing lists, and configuring notification settings.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Multi-Platform Navigation
- **Successfully navigated to Reddit.com** using browser automation
- **Accessed Gmail inbox** at mail.google.com showing 10 unread messages
- **Navigated through Zoom settings** to locate email notification configurations

### 2. Email Unsubscription Workflow
- **Identified Upwork marketing email** in Gmail inbox
- **Used Gmail's built-in unsubscribe feature** via browser automation:
  - Hovered over email to reveal action buttons
  - Clicked unsubscribe button
  - Confirmed unsubscription in dialog
  - Received "Unsubscribed from this mailing list" confirmation

### 3. Email Management via API
- **Successfully removed Upwork email from inbox** using Gmail API:
  - Used `mcp__gsuite__query_gmail_emails` to find the email
  - Applied `mcp__gsuite__set_email_labels` to remove INBOX label
  - Email was archived (removed from inbox but preserved)

### 4. Documentation Creation
- **Created comprehensive email cleanup guide** at:
  `/Users/andrew/saga/saaga-mcp-servers/docs/claude-code-email-cleanup-guide.md`
- Guide includes:
  - Setup instructions for MCP servers
  - Common email cleanup commands
  - Workflow examples
  - Troubleshooting tips
  - Safety considerations

### 5. Zoom Settings Navigation
- **Located email notification settings** in Zoom:
  - Found Meeting > Email Notification section
  - Identified 5 enabled notification types
  - Navigated to Mail & Calendar settings tab

## Challenges and Limitations

### 1. Token Limit Issues
- **Browser snapshots exceeded token limits** when displaying full Gmail inbox
- **Solution**: Used hover actions to reveal UI elements selectively
- **Impact**: Required multiple attempts to locate unsubscribe button

### 2. Authentication Challenges
- **Gmail API initially failed** with "me" as user_id parameter
- **Solution**: Used actual email address "saaga@saaga.dev"
- **Root cause**: OAuth scope limitations or credential configuration

### 3. Browser Automation Stability
- **WebSocket timeouts** occurred when trying to click Zoom notification toggles
- **Multiple timeout errors** during browser interactions
- **Impact**: Could not complete disabling all Zoom notifications

### 4. UI Element References
- **Stale aria-ref errors** when page state changed between snapshots
- **Solution**: Required regenerating snapshots after page updates
- **Impact**: Slowed down automation workflow

### 5. Security Restrictions
- **Google sign-in automation blocked** for security reasons
- **Workaround**: Used already logged-in sessions
- **Impact**: Limited ability to demonstrate full authentication flows

## Technical Insights

### MCP Server Capabilities Demonstrated

1. **browsermcp**:
   - Navigation, clicking, hovering, screenshots
   - Element identification via aria references
   - Handling dynamic UI elements

2. **gsuite**:
   - Email querying with search parameters
   - Label management for organization
   - Attachment handling capabilities

### Effective Patterns

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining browser automation for UI interactions with API calls for data operations
2. **Hover-First Strategy**: Using hover to reveal hidden UI elements before clicking
3. **Incremental Navigation**: Taking snapshots between actions to track state changes
4. **API Fallback**: Using Gmail API when browser automation faced limitations

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Token Management**:
   - Need strategies for handling large DOM snapshots
   - Consider selective element filtering

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - Implement retry logic for WebSocket timeouts
   - Better handling of stale references

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Document OAuth setup requirements clearly
   - Provide alternative authentication methods

## Recommendations

### For Production Implementation

1. **Implement request batching** for multiple email operations
2. **Add progress indicators** for long-running operations
3. **Create pre-flight checks** for authentication status
4. **Develop specialized email-focused commands** that combine multiple operations

### For User Experience

1. **Provide clear feedback** when operations succeed or fail
2. **Offer dry-run options** for bulk operations
3. **Include undo capabilities** where possible
4. **Create email templates** for common cleanup scenarios

## Conclusion

This prototype session successfully demonstrated that Claude Code can effectively manage email inboxes using a combination of browser automation and API tools. While there were challenges with token limits and connection stability, the core functionality proved viable for:

- Unsubscribing from mailing lists
- Organizing emails with labels
- Archiving unwanted messages
- Configuring notification settings

The hybrid approach of using both browser automation and APIs provides flexibility to handle various email management scenarios. With the improvements suggested above, this could form the basis of a robust email management assistant.
