└── Failure Scenarios: API connection failed, JSON syntax errors, permission issues, server startup fails

**Step 3: Execution**
├── Trigger: Ready to test voice output
├── User Thought: "Time to make my coding assistant speak!"
├── User Action: Requests the LLM to speak (e.g., "Please explain this code verbally")
├── System Response: LLM recognizes speech request
├── LLM Action: Calls ElevenLabs MCP tool with text content
├── System Response: Natural voice output generated and played
├── User Perception: "Wow, my coding assistant is actually talking to me!"
├── Emotional State: Accomplished and impressed (9/10)
├── Success Criteria: Clear, natural voice output from coding assistant
└── Failure Scenarios: No audio output, robotic voice, API errors

**Step 4: Voice Customization**
├── Trigger: Desire to customize voice characteristics for better experience
├── User Thought: "I want to adjust the voice to better suit my preferences"
├── **Option A: MCP Call Method**
│   ├── User Action: Requests voice change through coding assistant (e.g., "Change to a different voice")
│   ├── LLM Action: Calls ElevenLabs MCP tool to change voice settings
│   ├── System Response: Voice updated and confirmed
│   └── User Perception: "Easy! I can change voices just by asking my assistant"
├── **Option B: Direct Config Edit Method**
│   ├── User Action: Runs CLI command to get YAML config location
│   ├── System Response: Displays path to YAML configuration file
│   ├── User Action: Opens YAML config file for editing
│   ├── User Action: Modifies voice parameters (voice_id, speed, pitch, stability)
│   ├── User Action: Saves configuration file
│   └── User Perception: "Direct editing gives me precise control over all settings"
├── User Action: Tests new voice settings with sample text
├── System Response: Plays sample with new voice configuration
├── User Perception: "Perfect! Multiple ways to customize - I can choose what works best for my workflow"
├── Emotional State: Satisfied and personalized (9/10)
├── Success Criteria: Voice preferences set via preferred method and tested, customized audio output
└── Failure Scenarios: Voice selection errors, parameter configuration issues, YAML syntax errors, audio quality problems

**Journey Completion:**
- **Total Time**: 20-25 minutes from start to fully customized voice
- **Emotional Journey**: Confident → Progressing → Accomplished → Satisfied
- **Technical Outcome**: Coding assistant now has personalized voice capabilities
- **User Experience Improvement**: Enhanced interaction with customized verbal code explanations

## Use Case Examples

### Code Explanation Scenario
```markdown
Developer: "Explain this function verbally"
Assistant: [Analyzes code] → [Calls ElevenLabs MCP] → [Speaks explanation]
Result: Natural voice explanation of code logic and functionality
```

### Debugging Help Scenario
```markdown
Developer: "Tell me what's wrong with this code out loud"
Assistant: [Reviews code] → [Calls ElevenLabs MCP] → [Speaks debugging advice]
Result: Verbal debugging guidance while developer focuses on code
```

### Code Review Scenario
```markdown
Developer: "Give me a verbal code review"
Assistant: [Analyzes code] → [Calls ElevenLabs MCP] → [Speaks review feedback]
Result: Hands-free code review while developer makes changes
```

## Technical Integration Points
