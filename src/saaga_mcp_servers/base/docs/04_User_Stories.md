When I import `from saaga_mcp_base.lib.logging import logger, tool_logger`,
Then the import succeeds and logging functionality is available.

**AC2 - Consistent Database Logging:**
Given external packages using the imported logger,
When tools log messages using either `logger` or `@tool_logger` decorator,
Then all log entries are written to the central SQLite database per TR-DA-LOG-001.

**AC3 - Multiple Package Support:**
Given multiple external packages importing the logger,
When `setup_db_logging` is called multiple times,
Then it doesn't cause errors and maintains a single shared logging instance.

**AC4 - Structured Logging with Tool Context:**
Given various tools and packages logging events,
When messages are logged with different levels and metadata,
Then the database stores structured log data including timestamp, level, tool name, and context.

**AC5 - Performance and Error Resilience:**
