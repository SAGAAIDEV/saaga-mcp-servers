# Saaga MCP Servers: Business Mission & Strategic Focus

## Mission Statement

**Transform fragmented business communication and workflow automation into seamless, AI-driven productivity platforms that solve real problems for social media managers, e-commerce operators, and sales professionals.**

## Core Problem Definition

### The Productivity Fragmentation Crisis

Modern businesses suffer from **workflow fragmentation** across multiple platforms and tools, creating significant productivity bottlenecks:
